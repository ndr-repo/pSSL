# pSSL - Passive subdomain discovery over SSL

pSSL is a tool I wrote in PowerShell to enumerate certificate transparancy logs using DoH (DNS over HTTPS). This provides an accurate list of hostnames and creates a glimpse of the network behind a target domain. Identify internal hostnames to maximize asset discovery operations and validate information diagrams.

For more on DoH, check out RFC8484 [here](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8484.html) or at the [PDF](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc8484.txt.pdf).
